# About

Hi there!

I'm Ervin, a software engineer with vast experience ranging from smaller, one-man projects to huge, distributed enterprise projects based on micro-services and event-driven architectures. In my time in the industry I raked up several IT certificates, which can be checked out in my [résumé](resume.md). 

I am also an [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) since 2022.

In my free time I like to tinker with even more technology. I also enjoy reading, video-gaming and sometimes watching Netflix.
