# About

Hi there!

I'm Ervin, a software engineer with vast experience ranging from smaller, one-man projects to huge, distributed enterprise projects based on micro-servicies and event-driven architectures. In my time in the industry I raked up several IT certificates, you can check them up in my [résumé](resume.md).

In my free time I like to thinker with even more technology. I also enjoy reading, gaming and sometimes watching Netflix.
