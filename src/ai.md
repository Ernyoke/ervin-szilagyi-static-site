# AI

Everything on this website is written by me. I don't use AI to generate content.

However, I use AI to help correct my grammatical errors. English is not my first language; in fact, it is my third, after my mother tongue, Hungarian, and the language of my home country, Romanian.

Initially, I relied on Grammarly for proofreading and corrections, but it offers a limited set of features without a subscription. After a while, I decided to use GPT-4(o), as I found it does a better job.

Finally, I consider LLMs to be valuable tools for learning, work and fun. But, I also think that they should be used where it does make sense. A personal website and blog should be something personal and have its own character.
