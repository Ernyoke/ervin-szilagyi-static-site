# My Experience with the AWS AI Practitioner (Beta) Exam

In June this year AWS announced 2 new certification exams: the AI Practitioner exam and the Machine Learning Engineer Associate exams. In the same time, AWS has the Machine Learning Specialty (MLS-C01) exam. You can still take this exam, and at the point of writing this article, there are no news of being retired, although we can assume that the Machine Learning Engineer Associate will take its place.

In the other hand, the AI Practitioner certification is an entirely new exam, the second foundational level exam aside from the AWS Cloud Practitioner one. Foundational level exams are considered to be "entry" level certifications, which can be attempted by people who do not necessary have an in-depth technical knowledge of cloud concepts.

From pure curiosity, I decided to attempt this certification. In my day-to-day job I work with AWS technologies and with LLM models lately, so I thought it would be an interesting challenge.
