    - Doing cloud automation and monitoring with CloudWatch/Event Bridge and Lambda.
    - Develop, design, and refactor cloud-based infrastructure using IoC tools such as Terraform.
    - Design and implement disaster recovery plans for services and platforms running on a global scale
    - Support a set of ETL jobs. Doing maintenance work, optimizations, monitoring, etc. (main technology stack: AWS Batch/AWS Lambda with Python, S3, AWS RDS, Redis)
    - Manage a set of relational databases deployed on AWS RDS. Planning and leading migrations from older platforms to newer and more up-to-date versions. Building highly-available solutions by implementing replications.

### RIA Solutions Group

The stack of technologies used for service development includes languages that run on JVM, Java 8, and Groovy with the usage of Spring Boot and other Spring libraries (Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring AOC, Spring Batch, etc.). It also includes NodeJS with the usage of JavaScript ES6 features.
     - Develop and integrate several features which require handling both relational and non-relational data. The technology stack implies heavy usage of Elasticsearch for indexing and searching huge amounts of client data. Besides, several services use MySQL/MariaDB databases for relational data and Apache Cassandra databases for non-relational data.
    - Work with real-time data streams using Amazon SQS and big data processing using Spring Batch.
    - Participate in front-end development as well, implementing several features visible to the end user. The front-end stack implies the usage of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with the usage of the AngularJS framework.
    - Practice test-driven development (TDD), and implement unit tests/integration tests for code changes where testing was feasible. Have in-depth experience with the Spock framework, as well as with JUnit4 and Mochito.
